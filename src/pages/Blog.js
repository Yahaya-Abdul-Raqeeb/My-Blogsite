    <p>On 28 August, Chelsea travelled to Anfield to take on Liverpool in a match that was billed as an early test for two title contenders.[10] Kai Havertz opened the scoring off a corner kick with a looping near-post header that spiraled over goalkeeper Alisson.[11] In the first half stoppage time, Reece James was sent off after referee Anthony Taylor consulted the VAR and adjudged that James had used his arm to prevent a goal. Mohammed Salah scored the ensuing penalty despite furious protests from Chelsea players. In the second half, Chelsea defended deeply and compactly and the match finished 1–1.[12]
